   performance testing
   security testing
   usability testing


Functional testing:
   It tests ‘What’ the product does. It checks the operations and actions of an Application.
   Functional testing is done based on the business requirement.
   It tests whether the actual result is working according to the expected result.
   It can carried out manually. Example: Black box testing method.
   It tests as per the customer requirements.

   Example: A Login page must show textboxes to Enter the username and password.


Non Functional testing:
   It checks the behaviour of an Application.
   Non- functional testing is done based on the customer expectation and Performance requirement.
   It checks the response time, and speed of the software under specific conditions.
   It is more feasible to test using automated tools.Example: Loadrunner.
   It is testing the performance of the functionality of the software.

   Example: Test if a Login page is getting loaded in 5 seconds.


Smoke Testing:

   This type of testing is performed before the actual system testing to check if the -
   critical functionalities are working fine in order to carry out further extensive testing.

   This, in turn, saves time installing the new build again and avoids further testing if the -
   critical functionalities fail to work. This is a generalized way of testing the application.


Sanity Testing:

   It is a type of testing where only a specific functionality or a bug which is fixed is tested to -
   check whether the functionality is working fine and see if there are no other issues due to the -
   changes in the related components. It is a specific way of testing the application.

   Advantages of sanity testing:

   Sanity testing helps in quickly identify defects in the core functionality.
   It can be carried out in lesser time as no documentation is required for sanity testing.
   If the defects are found during sanity testing, project is rejected that is helpful in saving-
   time for execution of regression tests.


Integration Testing:

   Integration Testing is performed when two or more functions or components of the software are -
   integrated to form a system. It basically checks the proper functioning of the software -
   when the components are merged to work as a single unit.


Regression Testing:

   It is type of testing in which one will perform testing on the already tested functionality again and again.

   Regression testing is carried out upon receiving the build of the software after fixing the bugs -
   that were found in the initial round of testing. It verifies whether the bug is fixed and -
   checks if the entire software is working fine with the changes.


RETESTING:

   It is type of testing in which one will perform testing on the same funcatnality again and again with
   deferent sets of values, in order to confirm whether it is working fine or not.

Note: Retesting starts from 1st build and continuous up to last build.
Note: During Regression testing also Retesting will be conducted.


ALPHA TESTING:

   It is type of user acceptance testing conducted in the software company by the test engineers just before
   delivering the application to the client.


BETA TESTING:

   It is also a type of user acceptance testing conducted in the client’s place either by the end users or third
   party experts, just before actual implementation of the application.


USABILITY TESTING:

   It is a type of testing in which one will test the user friendliness of the application.



COMPATABILITY TESTING:
   It is a type of testing in which one will install the application into multiple environments, prepared with
   different configurations, in order to check whether the application is suitable with those environments or not.
   Usually these types of testing will focused in product based companies.


MONKEY TESTING:

   It is a type of testing in which one will perform abnormal actions on the application. Intentionally, in order
   to check the stability of the application


END TO END TESTING:
   It is a type of testing in which one will perform testing on the end to end scenarios of the application.
   EX: Login---> Balance Enquiry ---> Withdraw ----> Balance Enquiry ---> Logout.


SECURITY TESTING:

   It is a type of testing in which one will check whether the application is properly protected or not.
   To do the same the BLACK BOX TEST Engineers will perform the following types of Testing:

   1. AUTHENTICATION TESTING: In this type of testing one will enter different combination of user names and
          passwords and check whether only the authorized people are able to access application or not.
   2. DIRECT URL TESTING: In this type of testing one will directly enter the URL’s of secured pages, in order to
          check whether the secured pages are directly access or not with out login to the application.
   3. FIRE WALL LEAKEGE TESTING(or) USER PRIVILLAGES TESTING: It is a type of testing in which one will enter
          in to the application as one level of user and will try to access beyond the user limits, in order to check
          whether the fire walls are working properly or not.


SOAK TESTING/REALIABILITY TESTING:

   It is a type of testing in which one will use the application continuously for a long period of time, in order to
   check the stability of the application.


ADHOC TESTING:

   It is a type of testing in which one will perform testing in their own style after understanding the
   requirements clearly.

   Note: Usually in the final stages of the project, This type of Testing can be encouraged


PARALLEL TESTING:

   It is also known as comparative testing and applicable to software products only. During this test, testing
   team compare our application build with competitors products in the market.


PERFORMANCE TESTING:

   It is an advanced testing technique and expensive to apply because testing team have to create huge
   environment to conduct this testing. During this test, testing team validates Speed of Processing. During this
   performance testing, testing team conduct load testing and stress testing.
