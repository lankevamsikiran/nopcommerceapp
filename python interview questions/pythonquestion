1) data types supported in python

Numbers
strings
boolian
List
tuple
set
dictionary

2)  key points of memory alllocation & management in python

* Memory in python managed by python private heap space.
* all objects and data structures are located in private heap space. and this is taken care by interpreter itslef.
* and programer doesn't have access to this private heap space.
* garbage collector is the mechanism to used to clean the dead object.
* Algorithm used in python for garbage collection is reference counting.

3)  what is PASS:

* pass statement is a Null operator. nothig happens when it executes.
* this statement used if the program requires no action but requires syntactically.


4)  Mutable and immutable:

Mutable: which can be editable
    list, set, dict
Immutablle: which cannot be editable.
    tuple,string

5) shallow copy:

it creates a new object from original object with its reference, so any changes made in values of new object will
also reflect in old object.


import copy

l1=[1,2,3]
l2=copy.copy(l1)

l2[1]=6

print(l1)
print(l2)

6) Deep copy:

it creates new object from originall object without its reference , so if any changes made in new object
 it will not effect old object

 l1=[1,2,3]
 l2=copy.deepcopy(l1)
 l2[1]=6
 print(l1)
 print(l2)
