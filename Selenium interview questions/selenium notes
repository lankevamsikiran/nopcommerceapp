1) initiating the browser

# Chrome
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
driver=webdriver.Chrome(executable_path="F:\pysel\chromedriver")
driver.get("https://www.facebook.com/")
driver.find_element_by_xpath("//button[@name='login']").click()
print(driver.title)
driver.close()

2)  Xpath:

xpath in selenium is a xml path used for navigation through the HTML structure of the page.
It is a syntax or language for finding any element on a web page using XML path expression.


 there are 2 types of xpath
 1 . Absolute path
 2 . Relative path

 Absolute path: it is direct way to find an element in th web page.
 but disadvantage of absolute path is that if any changes made in path of element then that xpath gets failed.
 *  key charactestic of xpath is that it begins with single forward slash(/),
    which means you can select the element from the root node .

  Relative path:  it starts from middle of the HTMLLL dom structuure. it starts with double slash (//).
  it can search elements anywhere on the webpage ,
  menas no need to write a long xpath and you can start from middle of HTML Dom structure .
  Relative xpath is always preferred as it is not complete path from root node.


3)  Navigation commands:
  *  get
  *  navigate
  *  back
  *  forward

4)  Conditional commands:

  *  is_displayed()
  *  is_enabled()
  *  is_selected()


5) is_selected():  is for radio button and checkbox weather they are selected or not.

6) working with dropdown :

from selenium.webdriver.suport.ui import Select

driver=webdriver.chrome()
driver.get()

element=driver.find_element_by_id()
drp=Sellect(element)


## there are 3 ways to get value from dropdown

drp.select_by_visible_text(" ")
drp.sellect_by_index(2)
drp.select_by_value(" ")


print(len(drp.options))

fot option in drp.options:
    print(option.text)
